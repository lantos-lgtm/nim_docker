#
# Docker Engine API
# 
# The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker client can do can be done with the API.  Most of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps` is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers, which consists of several API calls.  # Errors  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:  ``` {   \"message\": \"page not found\" } ```  # Versioning  The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API, you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message is returned.  If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.41) is used. For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.41/info`. Using the API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API, so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.  The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer daemons.   # Authentication  Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) (JSON) string with the following structure:  ``` {   \"username\": \"string\",   \"password\": \"string\",   \"email\": \"string\",   \"serveraddress\": \"string\" } ```  The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.  If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth), you can just pass this instead of credentials:  ``` {   \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\" } ```

  runtimes*: Table[string, Runtime] ## List of [OCI compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) runtimes configured on the daemon. Keys hold the \"name\" used to reference the runtime.  The Docker daemon relies on an OCI compliant runtime (invoked via the `containerd` daemon) as its interface to the Linux kernel namespaces, cgroups, and SELinux.  The default runtime is `runc`, and automatically configured. Additional runtimes can be configured by the user and will be listed here.

  isolation*: Isolation ## Represents the isolation technology to use as a default for containers. The supported values are platform-specific.  If no isolation value is specified on daemon start, on Windows client, the default is `hyperv`, and on Windows server, the default is `process`.  This option is currently not used on other platforms. 
  initBinary*: string ## Name and, optional, path of the `docker-init` binary.  If the path is omitted, the daemon searches the host's `$PATH` for the binary and uses the first result.

  initCommit*: Commit
  securityOptions*: seq[string] ## List of security features that are enabled on the daemon, such as apparmor, seccomp, SELinux, user-namespaces (userns), and rootless.  Additional configuration options for each security feature may be present, and are included as a comma-separated list of key/value pairs. 
  productLicense*: string ## Reports a summary of the product license on the daemon.  If a commercial license has been applied to the daemon, information such as number of nodes, and expiration are included. 
  defaultAddressPools*: seq[SystemInfo_DefaultAddressPools_inner] ## List of custom default address pools for local networks, which can be specified in the daemon.json file or dockerd option.  Example: a Base \"10.10.0.0/16\" with Size 24 will define the set of 256 10.10.[0-255].0/24 address pools. 
  warnings*: seq[string] ## List of warnings / informational messages about missing features, or issues related to the daemon configuration.  These messages can be printed by the client as information to the user.
